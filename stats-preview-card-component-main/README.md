## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first challenge where I made use of Flexbox. You can instantly see that it is an amazing tool, even if you are an absolute beginner. Im writing this readme a bit in the future, and there are a few things I would have done differently. I would have used flex for the mobile view as well if I were building this project now. The desktop version of the site also triggers a bit early, as the container has a fixed width that is bigger than 768px.
