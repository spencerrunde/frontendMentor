## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project marks the first time that I made use of CSS Grid. I built this project desktop-first as I wanted to focus on that. By using ```grid-template-areas```, I was able to define the "top" of the pricing grid as double the size of the bottom boxes. And then on mobile, all I had to do was set ```grid-template-columns``` to 100%, and redefine them all as equal.
