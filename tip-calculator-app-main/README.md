## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned a lot about SCSS before and while I was working on this challenge. Before, I didn't exactly see the benefit of using SCSS, but now that I've used it myself, I am going to continue using it going forward. I like the way that variables are defined in SCSS more than vanilla CSS, and the ability to nest styles within each other is really nice to have. And of course, when you compile the SCSS into vanilla CSS, it automatically adds several browser specific styles for you, so it takes care of a lot of "chores" for you.
