## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first time making use of routing with React. I specifically did this in order to work with BrowserRouter, and had the app switch between the play and game result pages. When it came to the rules popup modal I did some research. A common (unsure if best practice?) way of handling a modal is to render it to a seperate element outside of the root element, so this was the approach that I took.
