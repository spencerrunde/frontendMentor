## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Learned quite a few things while working on this challenge! I found that creating a menu toggle is quite simple, and only requires a few lines of JS. I also did some work with animations and keyframes to make the header arrow indicating for the user to scroll down a little more interactive.

This challenge required a lot of fine tuning in terms of flex and how the flex divs would react as the page got larger or smaller. I definitely feel that I have an even stronger grasp on how Flexbox works now.
