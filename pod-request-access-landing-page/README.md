## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Absolute positioning

### What I learned

For this project, I aimed for a much more "pixel-perfect" approach. Because of this, the desktop view doesn't look amazing on displays with bigger widths, as the design required the use of absolute positioning. On the specified design widths though, the website looks near perfect. Working with two media queries also took less time than I thought, as the design allowed for minor changes between screen sizes.
