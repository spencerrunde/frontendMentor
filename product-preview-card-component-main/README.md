## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

This was my first time working with Tailwind! I'm going to need to use it more before I have a concrete opinion on it, but I can see the early ups and downs of the framework already. I spent most of the time working on this project staring at the documentation. Not having to work with a CSS file at all is definitely nice, though.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The documentation that I made use of can be found here!
