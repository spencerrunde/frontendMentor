### What I learned

While working on this challenge, a learned about a few of the more unique css properties. I had never really made us of ```z-index``` before, but I had to here because of the circle images in the background overlapping the user's profile card. Setting a ``` border-radius ``` of 50% is also a neat little trick to easily make images circular.
