### What I learned

Curved sections look great! Learned a lot while working on this, and probably used flexbox more than I ever have before. I am unsure if I took the most optimal approach with creating the curved sections, as I know that there are many ways to set the images at the top and bottoms of the appropriate sections. It works though, and that was what I was going for. Will have to do more research for when I work with curve SVGs in the future.

Also proud of the little filtering trick I did on the footer logo svg to change it's color without changing the color of the same image in the header: `filter: brightness(0) invert(1);`
The above code makes the image black by setting its brightness to zero, then turns it white by means of inverting the color.
