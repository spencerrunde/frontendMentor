## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned to do some basic work with JSON data while completing this challenge. The JavaScript needed for this was actually fairly simple. Using `querySelectorAll` allows you to treat your HTML elements as an array, so I simply iterated over that array and replaced the `innerHTML` of each element with the cooresponding JSON data. I tried to make the JavaScript as small as possible, and I think I got close to achieving that, as it is only 57 lines of code.
