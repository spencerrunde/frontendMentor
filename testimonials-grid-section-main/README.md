## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge revolves around basic grid principles. I made use of grid-template-areas to define the location of each of the cards, assigning a grid-area property to them that matches said area. I could have coded this either mobile or desktop first, as all you need to do to change the layout is redefine the grid-template-areas.
